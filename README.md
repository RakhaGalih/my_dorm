My Dorm is a mobile-based application designed to streamline dormitory management at Telkom University. With over 60 UI pages and 11 structured modules, it supports key features such as resident check-in/check-out logging, package tracking, violation monitoring, announcements, and user management. These features are tailored for various user roles—Dormitizen, Helpdesk, and Senior Resident—ensuring each user experiences a workflow that matches their responsibilities. The frontend communicates with a Node.js backend through approximately 39 API endpoints, enabling reliable and secure real-time data transactions for actions like login, data retrieval, updates, and notifications.

To enhance user experience and system efficiency, My Dorm combines local and online technologies. It utilizes Shared Preferences to store user data locally, allowing automatic login and offline access to certain features. Real-time communication is powered by Firebase Messaging and local notification systems, which keep users informed about new announcements, package arrivals, and important reminders. Additionally, the app integrates device hardware such as the camera to capture evidence of violations or document dormitory activities. This robust combination of structured modules, real-time APIs, notification systems, and device integration makes My Dorm a powerful and comprehensive solution for modern dormitory operations, ensuring convenience, transparency, and improved communication between residents and administrators.
