The application utilizes a local database (Shared Preferences) to enable features like automatic login, ensuring a smooth and personalized user experience even offline. It integrates Firebase Messaging and local notifications to keep residents informed in real-time, delivering important updates such as announcements, package arrivals, and reminders directly to their devices.

To synchronize data across platforms and enable efficient data management, My Dorm integrates with an online database via API, facilitating seamless data exchange and updates. Additionally, the application leverages hardware features, such as the device's camera, for capturing photos as evidence of violations and documenting dorm events. This combination of features makes My Dorm a powerful tool for modern dormitory management, offering convenience and efficiency for both administrators and residents.
